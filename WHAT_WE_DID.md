## Key decisions & lessons (durable)

- **Architecture (locked, `AGENTS.md` §1):** ECS Fargate; DynamoDB single-table +
  ElectroDB (over Aurora); Teleport SSH; identity-aware proxy + wildcard DNS (over the
  ~100-rule ALB cap); EBS-snapshot-as-persistence + scale-to-zero; Auth.js + CASL.
  Workspace runtime = **ECS-managed EBS** (compute creates/releases the task's volume;
  storage owns snapshot/restore/GC).
- **Engineering charter (`AGENTS.md` §6, CI-enforced):** strong typing + branded types;
  functional core / imperative shell; typed `@edd/config` (no magic values); fail-loudly;
  explicit named exports; SAST + Trivy; pre-commit; deps = latest ≥1-day-old.
- **Endpoint-only / swappability (HARD RULE §6.8):** the whole project — product code
  _and_ tests/fixtures — differs from real cloud by **endpoint/base-domain only**. Sim =
  sockerless from source (pinned submodule); file gaps upstream + halt, never work around.
  **Observability** follows this too: no custom audit store — derive from current state
  now, from CloudTrail/CloudWatch on AWS.
- **GC safety:** `Ec2StorageProvider` tags everything `edd:managed` and scopes enumeration
  to it — GC can never delete unmanaged EBS.
- **Lessons:** git push over HTTPS+`gh` (SSH key authed as wrong user) · TS6/pnpm needs
  explicit `@types/node` · Auth.js breaks under vitest → lazy `import("../auth")` ·
  `export *` collisions → explicit exports · ElectroDB scans need `{pages:"all"}` at 200+ ·
  Trivy secret-scans token-shaped literals → build dummies piecewise / construct in CI ·
  a sim that _accepts_ a call can still be non-conformant — audit vs the real API ·
  **browser e2e finds client/runtime bugs Node tiers can't** (unbound `fetch`, missing
  `transpilePackages`, `vitest` leaking through a public index).

## Milestone timeline (compressed)

- **2026-06-01** — Scaffold: public repo (protected `main`), `@edd/*` Turborepo, core
  state machine + ports/fakes, DynamoDB-Local harness + ElectroDB, CI + charter. Control
  plane (lifecycle API + CASL over `WorkspaceService`), Auth.js (GitHub+Entra), portal,
  reconciler idle pass.
- **2026-06-02** — **Consume sockerless from source** (submodule). Real endpoint-only
  `@edd/storage-ec2` + `@edd/compute-ecs`; evolved to the managed-EBS model; GC wired with
  managed-resource tagging. **Mock-free workspace e2e** (container-mode sim): data fidelity
  (write→snapshot→restore) + the full `WorkspaceService` lifecycle on real Fargate+EBS.
  Orphan GC + scheduled snapshots. Audited/filed the sockerless gaps (all later fixed).
- **2026-06-03** — **Mock-free auth, swappability charter.** GitHub (bleephub) + Entra
  (azure sim, standard Graph + ROPC) logins → real `normalizeClaims`+role mapping. Sharpened
  §6.8 to cover test fixtures; reworked both auth e2es to be swappable, filing/halting on
  every sim divergence (bleephub OAuth conformance, Entra provisioning, admin endpoints —
  all fixed upstream same-day). **SSH via Teleport** (real cluster, connect-as-principal +
  authz deny). **Pomerium** identity-aware wildcard routing (real proxy, OIDC = azure sim).
  **Wake-on-connect** control-plane half (`planConnect` + `connect()`, idempotent, on the sim).
- **2026-06-03/04** — **Portal features.** Base-image catalog: API (`CatalogService` CRUD +
  CASL + create-enforcement) and UI (admin page + create-from-catalog picker). **Playwright
  portal e2e** (built app, cookie dev-auth shim) — caught + fixed three browser-only bugs.
  **Activity heartbeat** (`markActivity` + `WorkspaceService.heartbeat`) completes the
  scale-to-zero input side. Designed **Phase 8 — admin console & observability**
  (`docs/admin-ui-design.md`).
- **2026-06-04** — **Phase 8 admin console (8A + 8B), mock-free.** 8A: the admin-only
  `/admin` sidebar shell, the live **Health board** (`HealthService` + real DynamoDB
  ping; providers/reconciler `unknown` until AWS), the all-workspaces table, and
  per-workspace **Inspect** (detail + bindings + snapshots + pure-derived lifecycle
  timeline). 8B: the **Overview** dashboard (`tallyWorkspaceStates`), **quotas** (per-role
  `EDD_QUOTA_<ROLE>`, pure `withinWorkspaceQuota`, create-time 409 enforcement), and the
  **Logs/Audit** screen — pure `deriveFleetAudit`/`auditToLogLines`, the
  `AuditSource`/`LogSource` ports with `DerivedAuditSource`/`DerivedLogSource` local
  adapters (audit derived from state; control-plane log stream live, reconciler/container
  streams **explicitly unavailable** until CloudWatch — no silent empties). All
  Playwright-covered. Observability stayed endpoint-only: no custom audit store; 8C swaps
  in CloudTrail/CloudWatch adapters behind the same ports.

- **2026-06-04** — **Robustness hardening pass** (no new features; AWS still gated). A
  coverage/robustness audit found one real bug: `DELETE /api/workspaces/:id` called
  `cp.remove` bare, so a concurrent double-delete (re-fetch in `remove` →
  `WorkspaceNotFoundError`) or a non-terminable state escaped as a **500**, unlike the
  sibling lifecycle routes. Fixed: the handler now maps domain errors like its siblings
  (`WorkspaceNotFoundError` → 404, others → 409). Added the missing **admin RBAC
  negative-path tests** (member/viewer → 403, unauth → 401 for all five `/api/admin/*`
  GETs), a `DELETE` route integ (owned → 204, repeat → 404, other-owner → 403), a
  control-plane assertion that `remove()` of an absent workspace rejects with
  `WorkspaceNotFoundError`, and core edge cases (orphan/snapshot selectors: empty inputs +
  the exact `>=` grace boundary; audit feed: empty input + zero limit).

- **2026-06-04** — **Hardening round 2.** Auditing whether the round-1 `DELETE` 500 was a
  one-off found the **same bug class** in the catalog: `CatalogService.update`/`remove`
  throw `BaseImageNotFoundError`, but `PATCH`/`DELETE /api/base-images/:id` mapped every
  error to 409, so editing/deleting a missing entry returned **409 instead of 404** (and,
  unlike the workspace `DELETE`, with no pre-guard it was directly reachable). Fixed both
  to map `BaseImageNotFoundError` → 404. Confirmed by audit that the remaining mutation
  routes (`connect`/`start`/`snapshot`/`stop`/`heartbeat`, base-images `POST`) already map
  domain errors uniformly. Added tests: catalog missing-entry `PATCH`/`DELETE` → 404,
  empty-body `PATCH` → 400, an exhaustive state-machine transition-matrix test (pins all
  15 permitted pairs, rejects the rest), and timeline same-timestamp / out-of-order
  sorting. core 60, web integ 24, all green.

- **2026-06-04** — **Typed error channel (Result + DomainError), part 1.** The two
  not-found mis-mapping bugs (#33, #34) shared a root cause: domain failures were thrown
  and hand-mapped to HTTP status per route via `instanceof` ladders, so a forgotten case
  was a runtime mistake. Fix is to offload it to the type system: `@edd/core` now has a
  `Result<T, E>` (errors as data, never thrown) and a `DomainError` discriminated union
  (`not_found`/`conflict`/`invalid`); the web shell has **one** exhaustive
  `Record<DomainError["kind"], number>` mapper (`domainErrorResponse`), so adding a kind
  without a status is a compile error and routes never hand-map. **Part 1** converted
  `CatalogService` (`update`/`remove`/`assertEnabled` → `Result`, dropped the
  `BaseImageNotFoundError` class) and the base-image + workspace-create routes; behaviour
  preserved (same statuses, incl. the #34 404s). Part 2 converts the workspace lifecycle
  core + `WorkspaceService` + routes + reconciler.

- **2026-06-04** — **Typed error channel, part 2 (the workspace vertical).** Completed the
  Result refactor across the lifecycle core: the state machine's `transition` and the
  workspace domain fns (`markStopped`/`markStarted`/`markActivity`/`assertTerminable`) now
  return `Result<_, DomainError>`; `WorkspaceService` (`stop`/`start`/`connect`/`heartbeat`/
  `snapshot`/`remove` + `require`) threads them and returns Result; the five workspace
  routes unwrap via the central `domainErrorResponse` mapper. Deleted the
  `InvalidTransitionError` and `WorkspaceNotFoundError` classes and every bare
  `throw new Error` in the domain/shell — domain failures are values now, so the compiler
  forces handling at each call site. The **reconciler** was the subtle bit: with `stop`/
  `snapshot` no longer throwing, a lost state race would have been silently swallowed, so
  it now **skips and counts** (`{scanned, stopped|snapshotted, skipped}`) rather than
  aborting the sweep (and one racy workspace no longer crashes maintenance). Behaviour-
  preserving (all HTTP statuses unchanged). core 68, control-plane integ 15, web integ 24,
  reconciler 7+5, Playwright 8; build + lint green.

- **2026-06-04** — **Type system does more heavy lifting (round 1): exhaustiveness +
  alignment.** Made the compiler enforce what tests were checking by string. Added
  `assertNever` (core) for `switch` exhaustiveness (`planConnect`, service `connect`).
  Replaced `tallyWorkspaceStates`'s hand-maintained `ALL_STATES` array + `as` cast with a
  `Record<WorkspaceState, number>` literal, so adding a state is a compile error (no silent
  miscount). Made `Role` a single source in `@edd/authz` (a `ROLES` tuple → derived union)
  and typed `DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_QUOTAS` as `Record<Role, number | null>` (was
  `Record<string, …>`) and `QUOTA_ROLES = ROLES` — a new/typo'd role is now a compile
  error wherever roles are enumerated. Added `expectTypeOf` contract↔domain alignment
  tests (control-plane) pinning the independently-defined Zod enums to the core unions
  (`WorkspaceState`/`HealthStatus`/`LogStream`/`LogLevel`) — type-checked by `tsc`, so they
  can't flake. (Note: kept `assertNever` out of the web client path — importing it into
  `availableActions` pulled `@edd/core` into the Turbopack client bundle; the non-`undefined`
  return type already makes that switch exhaustive.)

- **2026-06-04** — **Type system does more heavy lifting (round 2): typed test-id
  registry.** Killed the Playwright suite's flaky, copy-dependent selectors
  (`getByText("running")`, `.filter({ hasText: "control-plane" })`). Added one shared typed
  const `apps/web/lib/testids.ts` (`TESTID` + `TestId`); components render `data-testid`
  plus typed `data-*` attributes (state/status/enabled/available/event/action/stat/role),
  and the tests **locate by id, assert on the attribute** — never on rendered text. Because
  both component and test import the one const, renaming/removing an id is a compile error
  on both sides. Annotated WorkspaceCard, the catalog cards, HealthBoard, the admin
  workspaces table, Overview tiles, Inspect timeline, Logs audit/stream panels, Quotas, and
  the admin-denied gate. All 8 browser tests pass on the new selectors; build + lint green.

- **2026-06-04** — **Harness determinism (round 3): the integ suite stops racing.** The
  CI `integration` job's `dynamodb-local` service container had no health check, so
  `pnpm test:integ` could start before DynamoDB Local accepted connections — the first-run
  race that occasionally skipped/failed the suite. Added `waitForDynamo` (`@edd/db`): polls
  `ListTables` to readiness with a timeout, called at the top of `ensureTable`/`dropTable`,
  so every integ bootstrap (every package) is deterministic and a fast no-op once DynamoDB
  is up. Portable — no container health-check tooling required, same locally and in CI.
  Also added retry/backoff to the integration job's sim bring-up (registry rate-limit
  parity with the e2e/ssh jobs). Tests: `waitForDynamo` resolves against the live DB and
  throws deterministically (timeout) against a dead endpoint. db integ 5; build + lint green.

- **2026-06-04** — **Error channel reaches the UI.** The typed-error work stopped at the
  wire: the server returns `{ error: <message> }` with the right status, but `@edd/api-client`
  threw `Error("POST … failed: 409")` and discarded the body, so the portal showed a bare
  status. Added `errorResponse` (`@edd/api-contracts`) and an `ApiError` (carries the parsed
  server message + `status`); `send()` now surfaces the real reason (e.g. "workspace quota
  reached (5)") by parsing the `{ error }` body **strictly — no fallback**, so a
  contract-violating response fails loudly (§6.5). No UI change needed — `ApiError extends
  Error`, so the portal's existing `e.message` shows it. api-client 4 tests; build + lint green.

- **2026-06-04** — **Dead-code + copy-paste detection (CI + pre-commit), and a dedup pass.**
  Added **knip** (unused files/exports/deps) and **jscpd** (duplication) as a `code-health`
  CI job and pre-commit hooks (`pnpm dead-code` / `pnpm cpd`; configs in `knip.json` /
  `.jscpd.json`, jscpd gated at a 1% threshold). knip found 7 dead exports — removed/unexported
  (`unauthorized`, `ownsOrAdmin`, `OwnedWorkspace`, `CatalogOption`, `FetchTeamsDeps`,
  `StatusMeta`, web `HealthStatus`). jscpd found 10 clones (1.02%); deduped to 5 (0.5%, all
  test-setup boilerplate) by: a shared `unwrap()` in `@edd/core` replacing a `val` Result-helper
  copied across 3 test files; the workspace `GET`/`DELETE` routes reusing `loadOwnedWorkspace`;
  `WorkspaceService.persist` reusing `toWorkspaceDetail` (one mapping, not two); and the
  data-fidelity e2e reusing `EcsComputeProvider.client()` instead of reimplementing it. Also
  gitignored `temp/` (local scratch, e.g. manual screenshots). All tiers green.
