## Open decisions (need the user)

1. **AWS account/region & data-residency** — **the top blocker.** Gates real Terraform,
   Phase 1 deploy, SSH/proxy real federation, reconciler cron, Phase 8C observability,
   Phase 7, `e2e-aws`.
2. **Domain & DNS owner** — base domain for `*.devbox.<domain>` + cert/DNS owner. Gates
   the identity-aware proxy + ACM.
3. **VS Code distro** — confirm code-server / OpenVSCode + Open VSX (Phase 1 golden image).
4. **Identity-aware proxy** — confirm Pomerium (done on the sim; vs Authentik/in-house).
5. **Heartbeat interval & idle threshold** — scale-to-zero tuning.

Resolved: DynamoDB+ElectroDB · sockerless from source · Fargate managed-EBS · manual
real-AWS on `main` · AGPL-3.0-or-later · Turborepo+pnpm · CASL · dep floor 1440 · admin
observability = derive-now + CloudTrail/CloudWatch (no custom audit store).

## Done recently

- **IAM policy simulation + fck-nat ENI ops — sim gaps #427/#428/#BUG-1470 resolved upstream
  (PRs #431/#430/#429); submodule → `9e2640a`.** The `terraform-sim` CI job now runs four
  configurations every PR: default stack (with **IAM least-privilege assertions** between
  apply and destroy — `simulate-principal-policy` verifies `dynamodb:PutItem` allowed,
  `s3:GetObject` implicitly denied, `ec2:DeleteVolume` tag-condition enforced); **fck-nat
  NAT-instance** (`nat_mode=instance`); and the DNS/TLS path. Module got `reconciler_task_role_arn`
  output. Also BUG-1470 (EC2 position-dependent filters — `DescribeNatGateways`/`DescribeSubnets`/
  `DescribeRouteTables` ignored non-first filters) fixed upstream as part of #429.
- **Simulators over HTTPS (TLS) — mock-free Entra auth + SSH (`e2e-https` job).** All three
  sockerless sims serve over TLS (`gen-sim-tls-cert.sh` → self-signed CA in gitignored
  `temp/sim-tls`; `docker-compose.https.yml`; `EDD_SIM_SCHEME=https` flips `@edd/config`).
  The Entra login→group→role smoke (Graph + ROPC) runs over HTTPS with real CA trust
  (`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, **no `--insecure`** — fails without the CA), and SSH connect +
  authz-deny runs against the real Teleport cluster. Config-only (§6.8); no upstream gaps.
- **Terraform platform module + full non-mocked sim apply in CI.** Reusable
  Terraform/Terragrunt module for the whole stack (VPC + NAT [managed or **fck-nat**], KMS,
  DynamoDB single-table w/ GSIs, ECR, ECS cluster + Fargate service + autoscaling, ALB +
  optional ACM/Route53, scheduler, IAM, logs) with examples + README. The `terraform-sim`
  CI job **applies + destroys the entire stack against the sockerless sim every PR**
  (`55 added → 55 destroyed`, endpoint-only). The four-round upstream saga that unblocked it
  (#411→#410, #413/#414→#415, #416/#417→#418) is fully fixed; submodule → `aa33123`. Plus a
  portable `check-branch-current.sh` (fast-forward guard, pre-commit + CI) and the
  heartbeat-route 409 test.
- **Error channel to the UI + code-health gates.** `@edd/api-client` surfaces the server's
  typed `{error}` message as `ApiError` (strict parse, **no fallback** — fails loudly).
  Added **knip** (dead code) + **jscpd** (copy-paste, 1% threshold) to CI (`code-health`
  job) + pre-commit; removed the dead code knip found and deduped jscpd's clones
  (`unwrap()`, `loadOwnedWorkspace` reuse, `persist`↔`toWorkspaceDetail`, e2e↔provider).
- **Type system / de-flaking (3 PRs, all merged/done).** PR1: compile-time exhaustiveness
  (`assertNever`, `Record<Union,_>` literals — fixed `tallyWorkspaceStates` drift and
  `Record<string,_>` quota → `Record<Role,_>`) + `expectTypeOf` contract↔domain alignment.
  PR2: shared typed `data-testid` registry — Playwright locates by id and asserts on typed
  `data-*` attributes, not rendered text. PR3: harness determinism — `waitForDynamo` (in
  `@edd/db`, called by `ensureTable`/`dropTable`) makes the integ bootstrap poll DynamoDB
  to readiness instead of racing container startup (portable, no container health-check
  needed), plus retry/backoff on the integration job's sim bring-up.

- **Typed error channel (`Result` + `DomainError`) — complete.** Domain failures are now
  data returned in `Result<T, DomainError>` (never thrown), mapped to HTTP by one
  exhaustive `kind→status` table; a forgotten mapping is a compile error. Part 1
  (foundation, `CatalogService`, base-image/create routes); part 2 (state machine +
  workspace domain fns + `WorkspaceService` + the five workspace routes + the reconciler;
  removed the `InvalidTransitionError`/`WorkspaceNotFoundError` classes and every bare
  `throw new Error`). The reconciler now **skips and counts** a stop/snapshot that loses a
  state race instead of aborting the sweep. Behaviour-preserving (statuses unchanged).

## Available now (decision-free)

- **Phase 8 — admin console** (`docs/admin-ui-design.md`): ✅ **8A + 8B done.** 8A:
  Health board (`HealthService` + live DynamoDB ping), the `/admin` shell, the
  all-workspaces table, per-workspace **Inspect**. 8B: admin **Overview**, **quotas**
  (per-role `EDD_QUOTA_<ROLE>`, create-time enforcement), and **Logs/Audit** (pure
  `deriveFleetAudit`/`auditToLogLines`, the `AuditSource`/`LogSource` ports +
  `DerivedAuditSource`/`DerivedLogSource`, `/api/admin/audit` and `/api/admin/logs`, the
  `/admin/logs` page). All Playwright-covered. **8C is AWS-gated** (CloudTrail audit +
  CloudWatch logs/metrics + cost + real provider/Teleport/Pomerium health) — the same
  ports, an endpoint-only adapter swap.
- **idle-agent** that POSTs `/heartbeat` (its shape; the agent binary ships with the
  golden image, AWS-gated).
- Broader unit/integration/Playwright coverage. Two 2026-06-04 hardening passes fixed the
  `DELETE /api/workspaces/:id` 500-on-double-delete bug and the `PATCH`/`DELETE`
  `/api/base-images/:id` **404-vs-409** not-found mis-mapping, and added admin-RBAC,
  selector, audit, empty-PATCH→400, exhaustive state-machine, and timeline-ordering tests.
  An audit confirmed the other lifecycle/catalog mutation routes already map domain errors
  uniformly. The last open item — a route-level heartbeat-on-stopped → **409** — was added
  (`heartbeat/route.integ.ts`: 200 running / 409 stopped / 403 cross-owner). **No
  decision-free coverage gaps remain.**

> With 8A+8B done, the highest-value remaining lever is the **AWS account/region
> decision** (#1): it unlocks 8C _and_ the whole real-deploy track. Little
> decision-free product work remains until then.

## Blocked

- **On AWS (#1):** the `infra/terraform` module is **built and sim-apply-proven in CI**
  (full stack incl. the DNS/TLS path: VPC/ECS/ECR/DynamoDB+GSIs/KMS/IAM/ALB +
  ACM/Route53/HTTPS) — what's AWS-gated is the **real apply** (account + remote state
  backend), golden image + real Fargate deploy, wiring `apps/web` to real adapters,
  Teleport/Pomerium real federation + DNS, reconciler cron, Phase 8C (CloudTrail/CloudWatch/
  Cost), Phase 7, `e2e-aws`.
- **On DNS (#2):** real `*.devbox.<domain>` routing + ACM (the module path is sim-proven;
  the _real_ hosted zone + cert issuance is AWS/registrar-gated).
- **On upstream sockerless:** Six open issues filed after live probing (2026-06-05): **#433**
  EC2 LaunchTemplates (blocks fck-nat CI step) · **#434** KMS grants + secondary crypto ·
  **#435** ECR repository policy + image layer ops · **#436** ECS DescribeCapacityProviders +
  ListTaskDefinitionFamilies · **#437** EC2 DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings (needed after #433) ·
  **#438** ELBv2 listener rules + ModifyListener. Submodule pinned `9e2640a`, post-#431.

## Working notes (durable)

- **Sim = sockerless, endpoint-only (HARD RULE, §6.8).** Whole project — product code
  _and_ tests/fixtures — differs from real cloud by **endpoint/base-domain only**.
  Allowed: `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`, `AUTH_GITHUB_API_URL`, Entra authority, `entraSim`/`awsSim`/
  `bleephub` base URLs. **Not allowed:** `/sim/...` endpoints, hardcoded seed tokens/values,
  non-standard endpoints (e.g. `POST /user/orgs`), branches/fallbacks. If the sim/bleephub
  **diverges from the real API/behaviour** in something that matters, **file a
  non-conformance upstream and halt** — never adapt the test around it. (A sim that
  _accepts_ your call can still be non-conformant — audit behaviour vs the real API.)
- **Web e2e quirks:** Playwright runs against `next start` (Turbopack **dev** hydration is
  unreliable headless). Workspace TS packages need listing in `next.config`
  `transpilePackages`; the browser's `fetch` must be `bind`-ed. Auth in the browser uses
  the **cookie** dev-auth shim (`edd-dev-user`/`edd-dev-role`, gated on `EDD_DEV_AUTH`).
- **DynamoDB Local readiness** races first integ run; re-run or wait for `--wait` health.
- **check-deps churn:** "latest ≥1-day-old" gate goes stale mid-PR (esp. on date rollover)
  — `pnpm update --latest -r` + commit, and `terraform providers lock -platform=linux_amd64
-platform=darwin_arm64` for the TF lock.
- **CI registry rate limits:** harness bring-up steps retry/backoff (public.ecr.aws/Docker
  Hub on shared runner IPs).
- **Pinned versions:** Teleport `18.6.2`, Pomerium `0.32.2`, `@playwright/test` ^1.60.
