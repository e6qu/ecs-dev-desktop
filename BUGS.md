## Open

_(none in repo code currently known)_

## External blockers (upstream — `e6qu/sockerless`)

_(none currently known)_

Latest full simulator pass (2026-06-12, submodule `777ffd3`) found no other
sockerless fidelity bugs across the new live surfaces (real-CP wake chain,
live user journey, reconciler scale-to-zero, Auth.js callback routes).

## Resolved (repo)

- **BUG-gateway-token-auth (2026-06-12)** — `wake-and-forward.sh` authenticated
  with `EDD_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, but no control-plane code path ever accepted it:
  every real gateway call would have been a 401. Masked by the stub control
  plane in `ssh-proxy.e2e.ts`. Fixed by per-workspace HMAC machine-auth
  (`EDD_GATEWAY_SECRET`, `loadConnectableWorkspace`) + a chain e2e against the
  real control plane (`packages/e2e/src/ssh-wake-chain.e2e.ts`).
- **BUG-golden-image-sshd** — Fixed on the #532 follow-up branch: the golden
  workspace image now installs OpenSSH Server, writes the trusted workspace CA and
  `dev-<workspaceId>` principal file at startup, validates required SSH/agent env,
  starts `sshd`, and runs idle-agent/OpenVSCode as `workspace`.

## Resolved (sockerless — fixed upstream; full detail in `WHAT_WE_DID.md`)

**Most-recent batch** (submodule `777ffd3`, PR #549):

- **sockerless#547 / PR #549 (BUG-1743)** — azure-sim `/authorize` now honours
  `login_hint` (UPN lookup, ROPC-style resolution), binds the resolved OID into
  the auth-code record, and mints id/access tokens for that user; unknown hint
  → `error=login_required`. Graph-provisioned users can drive the interactive
  OIDC flow — the Auth.js callback-route e2e now asserts Entra group→admin via
  `login_hint` (HTTPS leg).
- **sockerless#548 / PR #549 (BUG-1742)** — azure-sim token endpoint accepts
  `client_secret_basic` across all grants; discovery advertises both methods.
  We keep `client_secret_post` (MSAL convention, valid on real AAD).

**Previous batch** (submodule `638f65a`, PR #532):

- **sockerless PR #532** — Added Azure Logic Apps/ACI and GCP
  Spanner/Dataflow/Bigtable simulator slices plus AWS SDK coverage cleanup across
  SSM, Glue, CodeBuild, Step Functions, CloudWatch Logs, SQS, and ElastiCache.
  No new ecs-dev-desktop blocker was identified from this PR surface.

**Previous batch** (submodule `dade6ca`, PR #531):

- **sockerless#530 / PR #531** — ECS container-mode `RunTask` now applies
  `overrides.containerOverrides[].environment` to the named runtime container,
  unblocking the managed-EBS golden workspace SSH e2e path.

**Previous batch** (submodule `39d15b5`, PR #529):

- **sockerless#525 / PR #529** — Azure sim now rejects duplicate Entra
  `userPrincipalName` values and ROPC uses the same case-insensitive UPN resolver.
- **sockerless#526 / PR #529** — ECS managed-EBS awsvpc task private IP reachability
  now works from a same-VPC task, unblocking the production-shaped golden SSH e2e path.
- **sockerless#527 / PR #529** — Fargate sandbox now grants `SYS_CHROOT`, so OpenSSH
  preauth chroot works in container-mode ECS tasks.

**Previous batch** (submodule `85a62bc`, PR #520):

- **sockerless#521 / PR #520** — Netns awsvpc ECS tasks from PR #519 could not
  reach simulator-adjacent endpoints used by downstream container-mode e2e
  (e.g. DynamoDB Local). Fix: netns metadata moved to link-local DNAT,
  `host.docker.internal` env values are rewritten for pause-netns ECS tasks,
  host egress masquerade is installed, and egress is governed by the simulated
  route table. Downstream e2e now provisions an IGW/default route and
  `AssignPublicIp=ENABLED`, matching that route-table model.
- **sockerless#522 / PR #520** — Netns VPC cleanup could return 503 if the backing
  route was already absent (`RTNETLINK answers: No such process`). Fix: subnet
  route cleanup tolerates that already-clean state.

**Previous batch** (submodule `cf7df7c`, PR #519):

- **BUG-1572 / PR #519** — Follow-up to sockerless#516: the Docker-bridge VPC fabric from
  PR #518 could not represent two AWS VPCs with overlapping CIDRs, and `DeleteVpc` leaked
  backing networks. Fix: a Linux network-namespace-per-VPC fabric (`VPC = netns`,
  `subnet = bridge`) for capable hosts, with ECS awsvpc tasks sharing a pause-container
  network namespace and keeping the real ENI IP with no CIDR remap. The older Docker-network
  tier remains for distinct CIDRs when netns capabilities are unavailable; overlap fails
  loudly there. Added tier-agnostic VPC reachability/isolation tests, a netns-only
  overlapping-CIDR test, and VPC fabric cleanup coverage.

**Previous batch** (submodule `7518722`, PR #518):

- **sockerless#516** — Container-mode ECS: `privateIPv4Address` was a virtual VPC-allocated IP
  that didn't route to the Docker container. Fix: each VPC is now a real Docker user-defined
  bridge (`sockerless-sim-vpc-<vpcid>`, IPAM subnet = VPC CIDR). Task containers are pinned to
  their VPC bridge at the ENI IP via `ContainerConfig.IPAddress`. The reported IP is now the
  container's real Docker IP — routable within the VPC bridge (intra-VPC), isolated from other
  VPC bridges (cross-VPC). Our `sshHost` field on `Workspace` is now populated with an
  actionable IP; the proxy e2e tests the full forwarding chain.

**Previous batch** (submodule `4b8bcd9`, PR #515):

- **sockerless#514** — Container-mode sim: scheduler-fired `RunTask` (EcsParameters target)
  silently swallowed downstream errors. `callJSONHandler` discarded the response and
  `fireECSTarget` recorded CloudTrail success unconditionally; the task was never launched
  or stopped. Also: SG validation was skipped for scheduler-fired path but enforced for
  direct `RunTask`. Fix: `callJSONHandler` now returns `(status, body)`; a shared
  `recordSchedulerFireResult` records failures honestly with `errorCode`/`errorMessage`;
  valid-config happy path unchanged. **Our e2e test updated to use real VPC/subnet/SG
  (commit `52376c2`)**.
